# Syndicate-OS
Syndicate-OS is a hobby Operating System which is being designed for superior simplicity for new users without trying to compromise for developers.In designing and coding i have taken every consideration into account which the modern OS are lacking. I will try to allow the user to go deep and customize the OS without lacking the security.

#That's it folks :)
I'm currently learning and trying to design my Syndicate-OS (SynOS). Rather than simply coding. Though most of the code have been taken from tutorials and other HobbyOS. Currently my OS doesn't do anything :( but i will soon add a shell and userspace.

Till then just come here for updates or contribute here. Maybe we can build a revolutionary change in the history of computer. Who knows..? ;)
